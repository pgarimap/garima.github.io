excerpt: "This review explores alternative earthquake prediction methods by analyzing hydrogeochemical anomalies, particularly ionic and molecular changes caused by hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide in groundwater. It suggests these geochemical indicators, along with microbiological responses, could enhance early-warning systems for earthquakes."

## Research Highlights
-  Identified ionic and molecular changes in groundwater as potential early earthquake indicators.
  
-  Analyzed data from 29 earthquake events, showing significant correlations with hydrogeochemical changes.

-  Suggested that changes in groundwater microorganisms' behavior could enhance earthquake prediction methods.
