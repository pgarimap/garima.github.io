excerpt: "As climate change intensifies, developing regions must play a crucial role in achieving net-zero emissions, but regional efforts remain underexplored. Our analysis highlights the need for substantial energy system transformations and increased investments, with varying adoption rates of emerging technologies like electric vehicles, hydrogen, and carbon capture across regions, requiring significant financial commitment to achieve a carbon-neutral future by 2085."

## Research Highlights
-Decarbonization in five regions of the global south to reach net-zero
emissions by 2085 is explored.

-Urgent need to quintuple renewable energy consumption by 2050 and to
halve non-renewables.

-Minor-emitting regions require a more drastic technology adoption rate by
2085.

-Over half of the investment for the decarbonization is needed for the years
after 2050. ​​
