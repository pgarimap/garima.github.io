## Description
Climate change has led to increased warming in Nepal's Himalayan region, altering the hydrological regime of the Gandaki River Basin (GRB). The change influences seasonal river flow patterns, important for irrigation and agriculture in the floodplains. Understanding these alterations is essential for effective water resource management and agricultural planning, particularly due to the critical role of water from snow and glacier melt during dry periods. This study aims to analyze the current hydrological regime of the GRB, assess the contributions of glacier and snowmelt to streamflow, examine agriculture's dependence on these water sources, project future climate scenarios, and evaluate impacts on meteorological and hydrological drought trends.

The Spatial Processes in Hydrology (SPHY) model, enhanced with a glacier module accounting for debris cover, was used to simulate glacier-related processes and quantify hydrological regimes. Calibration was performed manually with observed daily flow data from 2000 to 2019 at the Devghat stations. The model's performance was evaluated using multiple performance indices. For future climatic data, an ensemble of five global climate models (GCMs) from the CMIP6 model outputs were utilized for 2025-2100 under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways Scenarios (SSPs): SSP245 and SSP585. The forecasts were made using bias-corrected General Circulation Model outputs, applying Quantile Mapping for precipitation and a linear transfer function for temperature. Drought trends were analyzed using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI). The AquaCrop model was also used to analyze agricultural reliance on glacier and snowmelt under these climate scenarios, focusing on 93,710 hectares in the Chitwan and East Nawalpur districts.
