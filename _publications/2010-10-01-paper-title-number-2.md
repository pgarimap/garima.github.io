excerpt: 'Understanding the effects of climate change on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is critical, especially in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region, which is experiencing a rate of warming nearly triple the global average. Despite the region’s importance in supporting major ecosystems and a vast population, the impacts of climate change on specific SDGs and their interconnections remain underexplored. This viewpoint article discusses the influence of climate change on the interplay among various SDGs, with a particular emphasis on SDG 6, SDG 7, and SDG 15. By offering insights into these challenges, this article aims to aid in the formulation and achievement of more effective strategies for meeting the SDGs in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region.'
