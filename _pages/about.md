I am a fresh graduate of Civil Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering.

My research interests are in the field of water resources engineering, hydrology, environmental engineering, and energy transition.I am also seeking Research assistantships in the same.

I am currently working as a research intern at the Center for Water Resources Studies (CWRS), a research unit of the Institute of Engineering (IOE), Nepal.



#Selected Experience
======
## Research assistantship
During my tenure as a Research Assistant under [Assoc. Prof. Shukra Raj Paudel] (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6YJ9XJoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), I actively engaged in multiple international collaborative research projects. This period allowed me to work with esteemed professors from globally recognized institutions such as **Eawag**, **Duke University**, **the National Renewable Energy Laboratory**, USA, **Coventry University, and La Trobe University**. My contributions included handling complex research topics and authoring significant papers. Notably, I co-authored the paper titled ["Water, sanitation, and hygiene of Nepal: status, challenges, and opportunities"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00303), published in ACS ES&T Water, and another on ["Climate change challenges to meeting the sustainable development goals in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207233.2024.2322883). Additionally, I have contributed to papers currently under review, including studies on sustainable pathways towards net-zero emissions for developing regions and the implications of hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide as earthquake chemical precursors. I am also preparing a book chapter on the role of machine learning in the biohydrogen economy for Elsevier.

## Research Intern
As a Research Intern at the **Center for Water Resources Studies (CWRS)** since May 2024, I have been deeply involved in the development of a **gridded climate data product** for Nepal, covering the years** 2013-2023**. This project required extensive hydro-meteorological data collection from various sources, followed by rigorous data quality analysis and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency. I implemented temporal interpolation using the Inverse Distance Weightage (IDW) method and spatial interpolation through Co-Kriging to seamlessly integrate temperature and precipitation data across the region. This comprehensive approach has been essential for generating reliable climate data, contributing to ongoing efforts by the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat of Nepal and Tractebel.
