I am a fresh graduate of Civil Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering, Nepal. My research focuses on water resources engineering, hydrology, environmental engineering, and energy transition.

**Currently:** I am dedicated as a research intern at the Center for Water Resources Studies, Nepal (CWRS), aiming to develop a high-resolution gridded climate data product for Nepal. Furthermore, I am evaluating the role of machine learning in bio-hydrogen production, emphasizing bio-hydrogen as a sustainable fuel source for a net-zero emission future.

**My 2030 goal:** I envision reducing the vulnerability of people to the effects of climate change through the **nexus** of **water, energy, and the environment.**
